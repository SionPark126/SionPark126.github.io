                     Geoquiz project
                     This quiz is developed for a professor at Seattle Pacific University to
                     facilitate learning expereince for her students. The quiz provides the maps of six continents,
                     in which 10 random countries are colored for users to write its country and capital name.
                     The real quiz is integrated to Canvas and once students take the quiz and submit their answers,
                     it automatically posts grades to their Canvas gradebook.

                     Features:
                     - Clicking numbers will zoom into its corresponding country.
                     - Some possible misspellings get partial points.

                     I had an opportunity to expand the project to build a front end side of the database,
                     so the professor herself can add misspellings and edit the quiz data.

                     Tools and Resources Used:
                       Javascript, HTML, CSS, Digital Ocean, MongoDB, Openlayers API, Canvas API

                     Letter Run project
                     This is my senior software engineering project that I worked on with 3 other team members.
                     We used Phaser.js and Electron to create a 2D platformer game. My responsibilities were
                     implementing the game mechanics, adding assets to the game and creating stages.
